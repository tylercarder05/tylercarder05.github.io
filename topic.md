In early 2015, Apple became the first ever $700 billion company.  More recently, Apple [overtook Google](http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/photos/apple-overtakes-google-as-world-s-most-valuable-brand-1.3090892) as the most valuable brand in the world. Now, one of the original Apple computers sold for more than $387,000 in 2013.
